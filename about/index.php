                  <p>I am a developer at R/GA in New York, working on Nike brand sites. My interests are in front end web development. On a daily basis I am working with JS, jQuery, HTML, CSS. I use a lot of json and XML as well.</p>

                  <p>I do have experience with backend development, but it isn't one of my main interest, and isn't the type of development work i do day to day.</p>
