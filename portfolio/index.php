            <p>Nike wanted a mobile community hub to be paired with the pre-existing Nike+ Basketball. Exclusive to members of the Nike+ Basketball community, members can login on their mobile devices to join the community of pros, players and coaches sharing their knowledge, comparing their performance and elevating their game. </p>

            <p>For an upcoming football season, Nike asked R/GA to create a new experience which could pull together all the knowledge they had accumulated from their partnership with pro athletes. We ended up with a huge database of questions and answers that users can filter based on position. </p>

            <p>To coincide with the 2012 Summer Olympics - Nike launched their Game On World campaign to inspire people around the world to be active and join challenges online against other countries. R/GA worked on a few different challenges, one of which was for Nike+ Basketball users to showcase their dunking skills in weekly challenges. Users would use the Nike+ Basketball to video themselves preforming a dunk challenge and submit it to our site via YouTube, then they would be judged via pro athletes. </p>

            <p>R/GA worked with Nike Running to create a race training program to help runners hit their goals. As runners are getting ready to start to train for a race, they can log in to Facebook and head over to the Race Coach hub where they can preview plans, and watch introduction videos. Once they choose which level is right for them, they can simply download and subscribe on their native calendar application. </p>

            <p>Nike asked R/GA to create a new experience on the running website for people to explore their latest Nike Free Run+ running shoes. We ended up with a paralax-type micro site which features 3 sections, where users can learn about the new shoes, the 3.0 4.0 and 5.0 versions. Users can get inspired to create their own NikeiD Free Run shoes. Lastly they can learn about Free Ambassadors, appointed by Nike to inspire the community to run free. </p>

            <p>This project was my senior capstone project. It was a twenty week long project sponsored by Xerox to create the Future Workplace of 2020 in which I collaborated with a group of 4 designers and 2 developers. After extensive research of technologies of the future, we created an advanced management system called Ziva. At the center of Ziva is a versatile system which connects supervisory users with synced individuals. This system is meant to simplify organization, improve communication and increase efficiency in virtually any industry it is applied to.</p>

            <p><strong>Our team is proud to have placed third prize, of the eight teams sponsored by Xerox.</strong><br>I would like to give recognition to my other teammates: Michelle Postle, Valentin Drown, Ruth Sylvestre, Nicole Formica, and Danielle Furman.</p>
